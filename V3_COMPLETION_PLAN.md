# V3 Completion Plan - Oracle-Guided Fixes

## Executive Summary
The V2â†’V3 migration was reported as complete but analysis revealed missing features, architectural inconsistencies, and bugs. This plan addresses the identified gaps to achieve true feature parity and proper re-frame architecture.

## Issues Identified by Oracle Review

### ðŸš¨ High Priority - Missing Core Features
1. **24h Trades Count Missing** âœ… COMPLETED
   - Present in V2 cards, omitted in V3
   - User loses liquidity indication
   - **Action**: Add trades-24h row back to crypto cards

2. **Memory Usage Investigation** ðŸ†˜ URGENT
   - Safari reports "significant memory" usage and reloads page
   - **Action**: Profile memory usage, identify leaks/bloat sources, implement fixes
   - Potential causes: setInterval leaks, DOM accumulation, re-frame subscription leaks, large data retention

3. **Portfolio Storage Inconsistency**
   - Data stored in BOTH re-frame app-db AND reagent atoms
   - Re-frame code exists but unused (dead code)
   - Atoms currently handle all UI interactions
   - **Root Cause**: Previous instance fell back to atoms due to "localStorage issues"
   - **Oracle Finding**: localStorage issues were self-inflicted bugs, not technical limitations
   - **Action**: Fix re-frame localStorage bugs and complete migration

### ðŸ”§ Medium Priority - UI/UX Regressions  
3. **Compact Header Layout**
   - Current: Multi-line header takes too much vertical space
   - **Action**: 
     - Version - crypto tracker - timestamp on one line (smaller font for tracker)
     - Remove "Real-time cryptocurrency prices - Re-frame Architecture" subtitle
     - TOTAL PORTFOLIO VALUE and value on one line with smaller font

4. **Portfolio Button/Value UI Behavior**
   - V2: Smart component - button when empty, clickable value when holdings exist
   - V3: Always shows both button AND value (redundant UI)
   - **Action**: Implement V2's conditional UI logic

5. **Flash Dispatch Bug**
   - First update flash never fires due to dispatch overwrite in `:smart-price-update`
   - **Action**: Fix cond-> logic to avoid :dispatch key collision

### âœ… Acceptable Changes
- Bid/Ask section removal (user confirmed not valuable due to non-live feeds)
- Last-update badge moved from bottom to top-right (visual preference)

## Technical Root Causes Analysis

### Portfolio localStorage "Issues" (Oracle Findings)
The previous instance claimed re-frame localStorage was problematic. Oracle analysis revealed:

1. **Duplicate Event Registration**
   - `events.cljs` and `portfolio.cljs` both register same event IDs
   - Last-loaded file silently overwrites first â†’ random behavior
   
2. **JS/CLJS Data Type Mixing**
   - JSON parsed objects stored directly in app-db (JS objects)
   - Subsequent operations create CLJS maps
   - Inconsistent data shapes between save/restore

3. **Competing Persistence Strategies**
   - Two different fx handlers for same functionality
   - Different localStorage keys used

**Conclusion**: Fallback to atoms was unnecessary - issues are fixable.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Snapshot & Setup
- [ ] Document current state in this plan
- [ ] Commit/push/tag as `v3-pre-completion-fixes`
- [ ] Oracle pre-analysis for each fix

### Phase 2: Memory Usage Investigation
- [ ] Oracle: Analyze V3 codebase for memory leak sources
- [ ] Profile browser memory usage during normal operation
- [ ] Check for setInterval cleanup issues
- [ ] Investigate re-frame subscription lifecycle
- [ ] Measure DOM node accumulation
- [ ] Test with different browsers to isolate Safari-specific issues

### Phase 3: Portfolio Storage Consolidation
- [ ] Oracle: Analyze current portfolio code paths
- [ ] Fix duplicate event registrations (remove portfolio.cljs or rename IDs)
- [ ] Fix JS/CLJS data mixing (consistent keywordized maps)
- [ ] Migrate UI components from atoms to re-frame subscriptions/dispatch
- [ ] Remove portfolio-atoms.cljs and related dead code
- [ ] Test portfolio persistence thoroughly

### Phase 4: Missing Features
- [ ] Oracle: Review V2 trades-24h implementation  
- [ ] Add trades-24h field to crypto cards in V3
- [ ] Oracle: Analyze V2 portfolio UI behavior
- [ ] Implement smart portfolio button/value component

### Phase 5: Bug Fixes
- [ ] Oracle: Review flash dispatch logic
- [ ] Fix cond-> dispatch overwrite in `:smart-price-update`
- [ ] Clear setInterval IDs to prevent memory leaks (optional)

### Phase 6: Validation
- [ ] Oracle: Final architecture review
- [ ] Test all features against V2 parity checklist
- [ ] Performance comparison
- [ ] Commit final state with comprehensive tag

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All V2 features present in V3 (minus bid/ask)
- [ ] Single source of truth for all data (re-frame app-db only)
- [ ] No dead code or unused atoms
- [ ] localStorage persistence works reliably
- [ ] UI behavior matches V2 expectations
- [ ] No architectural inconsistencies

## Risk Mitigation
- Oracle consultation before each major change
- Incremental commits after each fix
- Rollback plan using snapshot tag
- Test after each phase completion
